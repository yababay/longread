‘The first foreign loan issued by tsarist Russia was floated in 1769
(Bovykin, 1990). At the beginning of the twentieth century, Russian
bonds were listed on all major European stock exchanges (Amsterdam,
Berlin, Paris, and London). France was the largest market for Russian
securities. At a time when Paris was one of the major exchanges and
France was exporting capital on a massive scale, Russian securities as a
whole represented 25 percent of French foreign investment (Feis 1930).



Just before the outbreak of the First World War, almost half of Rus-
sian sovereign bonds were held outside Russia. Ukhov (2003) estimates
that the percentage of foreign-held sovereign bonds rose from roughly
43.5 percent in 1893 to 49.7 percent in 1913. Russian sovereign bonds
represented only part of the investments made in Russia. In the late
nineteenth century many investors had also bought industrial securities
from firms active in the country. Furthermore, the First World War
had prompted Russia's allies to advance funds in order to wage the war.
The amounts held in a given country varied substantially depending on
the form of the claims. According to Paslovsky and Moulton (1924, 21),
80 percent of the prewar government debt was held in France, Great
Britain coming second with 14 percent. Industrial securities were more
widely distributed: France was first (32 percent), Great Britain second (25
percent), Germany third (16 percent), Belgium fourth (15 percent), and
the United States fifth (6 percent). War debts were owed to Great Britain
(70 percent), France (19 percent), and the United States (7 percent).

The quantity of Russian bonds held in France in the late nineteenth
century may surprise a twenty-first-century reader. Although Russia is
still a major economic power, it is inconceivable today that more than
1.6 million French people would own Russian securities worth almost
4.5 percent of national wealth. Yet those were the figures cited in a 1919
inventory of repudiated Russian debt. Some fifty-two Russian govern-
ment securities were listed on the Paris Bourse, along with a large quan-
tity of industrial paper.> While estimates of the nominal value of the
debt vary, they are all huge. In a speech to the French National Assembly
in January 1918 the deputy Emmanuel Brousse estimated that almost 15
billion francs had been lent to Russia, while in March 1920 the senator
Anatole de Monzie advanced a figure of around 14 billion francs.* The
French National Securities Office (Office National des Valeurs Mobiliéres)
put the figure at between 15 billion and 18 billion francs.> According to
Raoul Péret, Russian sovereign bonds alone were worth nearly 12 billion
francs.° Girault (1973, 24), probably the best authority, suggests a simi-
lar figure, 11,719,638,166 francs. Although overestimated, because they
include bonds held by Russians abroad, these numbers are nevertheless
staggering.’ Niall Fergusson (2001, 289) has argued that the Russian de-
fault of 1917 was “perhaps the biggest default in history.’
Far from representing commitments by institutional investors, the
bulk of Russian bonds were held by small savers all over France. Clerks,
shopkeepers, industrial workers, and peasants were holding Russian se-
curities (Feis 1930). The many associations formed to defend the rights
of Russian bondholders, such as the National League for Claims of Small
Investors in Russian Securities (Ligue nationale de revendication des
petits porteurs de valeurs russes), give an indication of the large num-
bers of retail investors who were not particularly wealthy. In a speech to
the senate on 31 May 1919 the finance minister himself, Louis-Lucien
Klotz, described the exceptionally wide distribution of Russian bonds,
which he said were found in every municipality in France.? When the
debt was repudiated, the geographical origins of the deputies who raised
the question of the bonds in parliament mirrored the scattering of Rus-
sian bonds across France. The distribution pattern supports Freymond’s
claim (1996) that farming regions were hit hardest by the repudiation.

Although the repudiation was felt most keenly in France, inves-
tors in other European countries also purchased Russian bonds in large
quantities. As in France, Russian bondholders in the United Kingdom
lived all over the country.'° According to Luboff, the majority of British
owners of Russian bonds before the First World War were retail investors. Table 0.1 shows the percentage of Russian investment by amount
invested, based on holdings recorded by the British Union of Russian
Bondholders and the Russian Railway Bondholders’ Committee on 10
November 1929.

The amounts in table 0.1 show the predominance of investments of
less than 100 pounds. This fact alone does not establish that investments
came mainly from individuals who were not wealthy. On the contrary,
converted into today’s money, the upper limit of 100 pounds would be a
tidy sum.!? According to Luboff, however, the investors registered with
Russian bondholder defense organizations included stevedores, servants,
barbers, and tailors.

the question of the bonds in parliament mirrored the scattering of Rus-
sian bonds across France. The distribution pattern supports Freymond’s
claim (1996) that farming regions were hit hardest by the repudiation.

Proportionally to its size, Belgium also lent enormous sums to
Russia. During their inventory of Russian bonds in 1919, members of
the Committee for the Defense of Belgian Interests in Russia (Comité de
défense des intéréts belges en Russie) were astonished to find the amount
reached almost 300 million Belgian francs, despite having received only
a small number of replies.!° It is thought that Belgium invested more
than 1 billion Belgian francs in Russian bonds.

The types of Russian debt contracted before the October Revolu-
tion varied. Most of the Russian debt held in France, the Netherlands,
and Switzerland consisted of bonds issued before the war and purchased
by retail investors. That was also the case in Belgium, where there was a
high percentage of investment in industrial bonds. By contrast, Russian
borrowings from the United Kingdom consisted mainly of war debt,
representing advances to the Russian ally during the First World War
(de Monzie 1931, 256-57; White 1985, 26-28). That debt was so sub-
stantial that, as Eliacheff points out (1919, 131), Russia's leading creditor
at the end of the war was the United Kingdom, not France.

While it might not seem significant, the type of debt held by the
various allies and their citizens would play a decisive role in the subse-
quent negotiations. Depending on their situations, governments gave
prominence to different economic effects of the revolution. For coun-
tries whose Russian debt consisted of large quantities of bearer securi-
ties owned by the general public, the primary objective of the negotia-
tions with revolutionary Russia was to redeem the bonds. The extremely
wide distribution of Russian bonds made redemption a political issue of
high priority, since every bondholder was a potential voter. Conversely,
in countries that lent money to Russia to support the war effort, the re-
pudiation depleted the government's coffers but had only an indirect
impact on taxpayers. Furthermore, whereas the amount to be repaid was
fairly easv to determine in the case of bearer bonds, sovhisticated calcu-
lations were required to determine the respective amounts incurred by
each of the parties in the case of war debt. The loans also served dispa-
rate purposes. At least some of the debt issued before the war financed
Russia’s economic development, but most of the capital raised during
the war was spent on American, British, and French contractors.

These differences in the type of Russian debt held would strongly
influence countries’ demands and attitudes in the negotiations. In addi-
tion to their economic positions, the creditor countries had diverse geo-
political concerns. This was not lost on contemporary commentators.

As Claude Aulagnon observed on the eve of the Genoa Conference, the
goals pursued by London, Berlin, and Rome differed radically from the
positions defended by Paris and Brussels.'* According to White (1985,
28), the Belgian and French positions frequently converged on the pri- _
ority of repayment. Conversely, for the United Kingdom and Italy, trade
considerations rapidly took precedence over debt recognition.

Before analyzing the repudiation of Russian debt, I want to provide
some information about the context in which it occurred. Following are
descriptions of the conditions in which Russian bonds first appeared in
French portfolios, of the trading in Russian debt on the Paris market,
and finally of the sequence of events leading to the repudiation in early
1918 and its impact on market prices.

Russian Bonds Make Their Appearance
in French Portfolios

Girault (1973) catalogues the reasons that prompted France, and partic-
ularly French retail investors, to invest considerable sums in Russian
bonds.'5 There was a visible rapprochement between Russia and France
in the late nineteenth century, underscored by high-profile events. At
the same time, French companies were encouraged to invest in the tsar-
ist empire in order to strengthen the Russian ally and accelerate its in-
dustrialization. The appearance of Russian bonds in French portfolios
was thus driven primarily by the geopolitical climate. In practice, banks
and the press encouraged French investors to buy Russian bonds.

Until the early 1880s the main markets for Russian sovereign
bonds were the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and to a lesser extent
Germany. France, which had tense relations with Russia, was only a a


ondary market.!° The accession of Alexander III to the Russian throne,

combined with difficulties in placing new bond issues in the United
Kingdom and Germany, prompted Russia to seek to raise capital in
France. Although some Russian debt securities were already listed on
the Paris market, the issues of 1888-90 represented the real beginnings
of French investors’ enthusiastic embrace of Russian bonds. Political fac-
tors played a role in the success of the first bond issues, but their popu-
larity in France seems to have been driven initially by purely commercial
interest. As Girault (1973) points out, the first large issue of Russian debt
in France took place several years before the Franco—-Russian Alliance.
To a French saver in the late nineteenth century, Russian bonds
seemed a safe investment, promising higher interest than the French _
in France took place several years before the Franco—-Russian Alliance.
To a French saver in the late nineteenth century, Russian bonds
seemed a safe investment, promising higher interest than the French
alternative—the rente 3 pour cent, a 3 percent perpetual bond. Eminent
economists confirmed the soundness of Russian bonds. The free-market
economist Paul Leroy-Beaulieu considered himself prudent when he ad-
vised savers to invest up to 10 percent of their portfolios in Russian bonds
(Bainville 1919, 82). As Flandreau (2003) pointed out, most of the capi-
tal raised was invested in developing infrastructure and local industry,
both of which are revenue generating; therefore the perceived credit
quality of the Russian state remained high. At the beginning of the cen-
tury Russia had an impeccable track record and only a moderate debt
(Bignon and Flandreau 2011; Harrison and Markevich 2012). Some sec-
tors of the French economy, such as banks, benefited directly from the
issuance of Russian bonds in the Paris market. In addition to the com-
missions received by brokers for each issue, the Russian treasury depos-
ited a large volume of cash in France, notably with the banks charged
with paying the coupons to bondholders (Girault 1973, 34). The banks
were paid fees to manage the debt on behalf of the Russian state.
Although investors were probably motivated initially by financial
interest, the political ties between France and Russia would soon play an
important role in the valuation of Russian bonds. It is difficult to estab-
lish a clear causal link between economic investment and political rap-

lish a clear causal link between economic investment and political rap-
prochement, but it appears that financial cooperation may have paved
the way for political rapprochement. In the event of a default, lenders
could lobby their government to assist the debtor country. Similarly, a
government's goodwill toward an ally would facilitate issuance of its

bonds. In the case of France and Russia, financial and political factors
were probably mutually reinforcing and supported the large-scale place-
ment of bonds with French investors.
Political rapprochement between France and Russia began in 1890,
particularly with the appointment of Alexandre Ribot as the French
minister of foreign affairs. The rapprochement was driven mainly by
strategic concerns. France felt diplomatically isolated compared with the
increasingly powerful Germany, especially since the renewal of the Tri-
ple Alliance and the Italo-British rapprochement, precisely at a time
when the Russian government began receiving less financial support
from Germany. The coincidence of these two needs pushed France and
Russia into one another’s arms. The Franco-Russian rapprochement
was rapidly acted out in grand public events, designed to impress. These
included the tsar’s tour of the French exhibition in Moscow in 1891; a
visit by French sailors to Kronstadt in July 1891; a visit by Russian sailors
to Toulon in 1893; Tsar Nicholas II’s visits to France in 1896, 1901, and
1909; and several French presidents’ visits to Russia (Félix Faure in 1897,
Emile Loubet in 1902, and Raymond Poincaré in 1912 and 1914). These
events triggered a wave of Russophilia in France. Politically, the Franco-
Russian rapprochement was reflected in the signing of the Franco-
Russian Alliance, “one of the foundations of international diplomacy in
the period from 1893 to 1914” (Girault 1961, 67). The Entente Cordiale
signed by France and the United Kingdom in 1904 strengthened France's
diplomatic position. The integration of the two treaties gave rise to the
Triple Entente in August 1907. Patriotic motives probably played a role
in investors’ decision to lend to Russia. The French public certainly ap-

preciated the security provided by the Franco-Russian Alliance (Renou-
vin 1959). ;

The Franco-Russian rapprochement raised the issue of the relative
freedom of each party. According to Sontag (1968), Russia retained its
financial independence despite the substantial amounts it borrowed.
Sontag argues that Russia allied itself with France and sought cordial
relations with the United Kingdom solely in order to achieve its goals
while safeguarding its interests. Citing Russian foreign trade statistics,
Sontag (1968) suggests that Russia did not have to enter into an alliance
with France and the United Kingdom to receive a financial lifeline. Given

the size of the loans, however, it is doubtful that Russia had much diplo-
matic independence during the period considered here. Any major crisis
would have left the Russian empire with very little room to maneuver.

The loans could also be used as a diplomatic weapon in the other direc-
tion. Since the French government could not afford to leave the holders
of Russian bonds to their fate, the enormous loans to Russia made
France practically hostage to Russia. Consequently, the impact of the
Russian government’ direct or indirect action would be considerable.

From the early 1890s on, the French press was encouraged to take
an interest in Russia. Considered an indispensable ally in the event of
war, Russia enjoyed the flattering coverage it received in the columns of
French newspapers. The press, under the approving eye of the French
government, thus fanned the nascent Russophilia in France. As it staged
symbolic events and arranged bond issues, the government could count
on the support of the French press, whose actions contributed to the suc-
cess of several issues of Russian debt (Girault 1973, 243-44). To support
its strategic aims the French government had no qualms about adopting
an attitude that was questionable at best. As Long (1972) indicates,
members of the French government encouraged Russian ministers to
grease the palms of French journalists to minimize negative coverage of
the Russo-Japanese War and the revolution of 1905. The Russian gov-
ernment spent more than 2.5 million francs in 1904-6 alone, the French
government acting as a catalyst, to use Long’s (1972) term. In fairness to
the French, the Russian state did not exactly wait for approval to imple-
ment a sweeping campaign of bribery among journalists (Long 1972;
Raffalovitch 1931).


Long (1972) attributes the venality of the French press to two fac-
tors: fierce competition between newspapers, which had to rely on small
print runs, and the limited success of advertising as a source of revenue.
Bignon and Flandreau (2011) show that newspapers of lesser reputation
exploited the absence of proper libel laws to publish damaging allega-
tions.!” Their influence was limited by two factors: the existence of seri-
ous newspapers investigating the truth of rumors and the emergence of
“publicity brokers,’ whose job was to pool bribes and ensure positive
press coverage. As a result, many firms were subsidizing the French
press. In 1931 La librairie du Travail published some of the correspon-



dence between the tsarist government and Arthur Raffalovitch, the tsar’s
representative in Paris and an economist of repute in France. The letters
reveal the scale of the corruption. Despite the sensational nature of this
revelation, few newspapers reported it at the time. But neither did they
refute it, despite the jaw-dropping number of journalists and news-
papers that allegedly benefited from tsarist Russia's largesse.'* Raffalo-
vitch’s report for 1896 mentions Le Journal Officiel, Le Messager de Paris,
Le Journal des débats, Le Temps, L-Economiste francais, Le Monde écono-
mique, Le Petit Parisien, Le Nord, Le Rentier, La Revue économique, and
La Semaine financiére. Over the years other titles joined the list (Le Petit
Journal, Le Matin, Le Figaro, etc.), while the least “useful” ones lost their
“subsidies” (Raffalovitch 1931). Bignon and Flandreau (2011) show that
the so-called Russian subsidies were mostly paid to the high-quality
journals. The length of the list suggests wholesale corruption of the
press. However, this impression should be qualified because a few rela-
tively more independent newspapers actually ran a campaign against
Russian bonds during the events of 1904 and 1905. Surprising as it may
seem nowadays, one may also wonder whether Russia could have
avoided bribing the press. Bignon and Flandreau (2011, 625) suggest
that this was basically impossible when enemies were ready to subsidize
negative rumors: “Russia had no choice but to forestall bad press with
negative rumors: “Russia had no choice but to forestall bad press with
purchases of publicity and bribes”

The years 1904 and 1905 played a key role in the development of
the Russian debt issue. The 1905 revolution can be considered a dress
rehearsal for the revolutions of 1917, insofar as in 1905 the revolution-
aries made clear their position on tsarist debt. The Russo-Japanese War
reinforced the interdependence between the Russian empire and the
French financial market. In terms of the political environment and the
repudiation, 1905 was what Pipes (1990) calls a foreshock.

Amid domestic political turbulence, Russia found itself engaged
in a war with Japan. The origins of the war have been discussed in depth
(Pipes 1990, 11). Some authors maintain that “a war could have been
avoided if Russia’s foreign policy had been in competent hands” (Figes
1996, 168). In any case, Japan’s expansionist designs on Korea and Man-
churia collided with the Russian presence in the Far East. The surprise
attack on the Russian fleet at Port Arthur on 8 February 1904 was the
spark that ignited the conflict. The racially prejudiced Russian high com-
mand was convinced of its superiority, and this overconfidence resulted
in woeful handling of the conflict. Russia became mired in a war initially
presented as easily winnable, fueling criticism from the opposition,
which denounced the government as incompetent (Figes 1996, 169-70).
In July 1904, during the uncertainty of the conflict in the east, Russia’s
unpopular minister of the interior, Viacheslav Plehve, was assassinated.
His reputedly more liberal successor attempted to introduce elected rep-
resentatives into state institutions. After hesitating momentarily, Tsar
Nicholas II rejected the proposed reforms, prompting the minister's res-
ignation and fanning the opposition’s discontent (Pipes 1990, 18; Werth
2004, 41).

In early January 1905 a group of workers attempted to deliver a
petition and supplication to the tsar. This never reached its intended
recipient, as the tsar’s soldiers fired on the crowd, resulting in a massacre
later called Bloody Sunday (Pipes 1990, 22; Werth 2004, 42). In the fol-
lowing months the protest movements radicalized, and the tsar’s uncle,
Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich, was assassinated. Meanwhile, the
Far East campaign went from disaster to disaster. The loss at Mukden in
March 1905 was followed by a humiliating naval defeat at Tsushima in
May, which forced the tsar to come to the negotiating table. The defeat
quashed Nicholas II’s hope that a resounding victory would silence the
quashed Nicholas II’s hope that a resounding victory would silence the
domestic opposition (Pipes 1990, 27). Instead, he was forced to accept
major structural reforms, notably the establishment of a parliamentary
assembly, the State Duma. Not long afterward, the Treaty of Portsmouth,
signed on 5 September 1905, formally ended the Russo-Japanese War,
confirming Japanese hegemony over Korea (Pipes 1990, 29).

How did the financial community react to the Russian empire's
troubles? The announcement of the outbreak of the Russo-Japanese
War depressed market prices for Russian sovereign bonds, both in Saint
Petersburg and in Paris. On 11 February 1904 the value of 4 percent
bonds fell to 90 percent of par, and the value of 3 percent bonds below
72 percent of par (Raffalovitch 1931, 20). In response to this sudden
drop in prices, the chairman of the stockbrokers’ syndicate, Maurice de
Verneuil, called on the Russian government to intervene, not by buying
back bonds on the market, which might have spurred an even bigger
sell-off, but by acting to ensure positive press coverage. Russia used two
methods to gain the favor of journalists. Regular payments were made
under the form of advertising, and in exceptional cases the payments
were direct bribes (Bignon and Flandreau, 2011). The war was such a
case, and the amounts paid as bribes jumped from 1904 to 1906 (Bignon
and Flandreau 2011). This intervention had the approval of the French
finance minister. It was not sufficient to stabilize sovereign bond prices,
however, and by the end of February another campaign directed at the
press was envisaged (Raffalovitch 1931, 24). As pointed out by Bignon
and Flandreau (2011), Russian interventions sometimes had a preven-
tive nature. During the Russo-Japanese War, Russia had no choice but
to float its bonds in Paris, as Great Britain favored Japan. Indications in
the French press that Russia was facing troubles in making ends meet
would have weakened the country and increased its borrowing costs.
Aware of this, Russia’s enemies were ready to subsidize negative rumors
about the state of its finances. However, Russian bribes sometimes back-
fired, as was the case when some newspapers that felt inadequately com-
pensated embarked on retaliatory smear campaigns (Raffalovitch 1931,
32-33). The Russian empire nevertheless succeeded in placing a 5 per-
cent treasury bill on the French market in May 1904 (Girault 1973,
405). Conversely, an issue in 1905 failed because of adverse military de-
velopments in Russia. The power of the press—and of those who bribed
it—receded temporarily.
At the end of 1905 de Verneuil appealed again to Sergei Witte, by
this time the Russian prime minister, to influence the press. Russia's
action must have been conspicuous because in 1920 a French senator
recalled that Russian bonds had been supported on the Paris Bourse
at the behest of the Russian government during the Russo-Japanese
War. Paradoxically, the Russian defeat was not presented as casting
doubt on Russia’s capacity to manage its public finances. Paul Leroy-
Beaulieu (1906, 661), one of the most prominent economists of the day,
went so far as to claim that the conflict demonstrated Russia’s financial
preparedness for a major war and its creditworthiness.”° After the
Russo-Japanese War, the Russian government decided to cut back on
its monthly payments to the French press. This letup was short-lived. In
light of the intense revolutionary activity on Russian soil, a proposal to
increase payments to the French press was suggested in November 1905
and acted on in January 1906. In a memorandum to the Russian finance
minister, Vladimir Kokovtsov, dated February 1906, Raffalovitch claims
that the action taken against the French press convinced the country’s
investors to hold on to their Russian bonds.”!

The close ties between French and Russian economic interests did
not go uncriticized.”* The poet and journalist Anatole France took
France to task for its financial support of Russia. He deemed France
partly responsible “for the follies and cruelties of Tsarism” by “giving
it the wherewithal to commit them by lending it the staggering sum of
nine billion.””> Anatole France attacked both the government’s wasteful-
ness and the use to which French money was being put. When Russia
sought to raise more capital on the Paris market, leftist newspapers and
figures mounted a protest campaign. The Socialists called for a boycott
of the bond issue.” In a speech given on 18 March 1905 Anatole France
said that subscribing to the issue was tantamount to “subscribing to the
oppression of a people ... to crime and madness.””> He echoed voices
inside Russia, such as that of the writer Maxim Gorky, who called for
the suspension of financial support for the tsar.*° The German kaiser
rejoiced at Russia’s problems and made sure no German money went to
helping overcome the problem the country was facing (Feis 1930).
In March 1905 Anatole France presciently announced that the tsar-
ist regime in Russia would soon collapse, giving way to a government
that would repudiate the debts contracted to suppress the revolution.’”
Quoting Gorky, he predicted that the new popular government would
recognize commitments made prior to the events of 22 January 1905 but
not “the bonds of massacre and civil war? The Socialist leader Jean
Jaurés, too, warned parliament of the dangers to which French lenders
were exposed: “You are cheating French lenders. The money Russia is
borrowing will never be repaid.” These dissenting voices did not suc-
ceed in severing the ties between French finance and Russian politics.
Conversely, the Russo-Japanese War and the events of 1905 radically
altered the balance of power between France and Russia.

By the end of 1905, after the military setbacks against Japan and
facing domestic unrest, Russia was left with only limited diplomatic in-
dependence. From then on France used its financial clout to gain politi-
cal leverage (Girault 1961). Criticism from the Socialist opposition did
not prevent a bond issue from being floated on the Paris market in April
1906. The French government supported the issue, which saved Russia
from imminent bankruptcy, on condition that the Russian government
comply with two French demands: the constitutional reorganization of
Russia, and Russian support at the Algeciras Conference (Girault 1961).
The market reluctantly subscribed the issue, since organized protests
and the threat of repudiation drove down the price (Collet and Ooster-
linck 2012). Girault (1961) convincingly describes the turnaround that
took place in 1906. Until 1904 France had to lobby Russia to be awarded
new debt issues, but from 1906 on France positioned itself as a creditor
demanding political advantages in exchange for loans. France main-
tained its role as leading financier until the outbreak of the First World
War, in particular by facilitating an enormous 4.5 percent bond issue in
1909. Not long before the start of the First World War, Franco-Russian
relations cooled somewhat, mainly because French industrialists were
disappointed with Russia's concessions to them (Hogenhuis-Seliverstoff
1981, 15). This cooling did not, however, represent a fundamental threat
to Franco-Russian relations.
The Reaction of the French Market in Russian Bonds

to War and Revolution
At the outbreak of the First World War, Russia’s public finances were
closely tied to the French market. Figure 0.1 shows the yields for the
Russian 1906 5 percent bond, 1909 4.5 percent bond, and the rente 3
percent from January 1914 to December 1917. The figures shown are
the yields to maturity computed on the basis of the opening prices for
bonds (published by official brokers in Cours Authentiques des Agents de
Change).

Several general observations can be made about this figure. First,
despite the war the yield to maturity for Russian bonds remained rela-
tively low until 1917. Second, the market seems not to have foreseen
the outbreak of hostilities, as yields remained fairly constant right up to
the last week of July 1914. Third, the whole market suffered a sudden in-
terruption during the war—the Bourse was closed from 3 September to
7 December 1914 and when trading resumed volumes were low.*° Last,
Russian bonds moved in lockstep with the rente 3 percent until January
1916, apparently influenced by the same events. Conversely, from Jan-
uary 1916 to February 1917 Russian bonds outperformed the rente.
Events on the Russian front did not really affect bond prices.

That Russian bonds were impervious to wartime events is prob-
ably owing to French and British financial support of their Russian ally.
In hindsight it’s clear the resilience of Russian bonds could not have
been based solely on the record of Russia's army and public finances.
French censorship of news from Russia, which lasted until 1919, also
limited price declines (Hogenhuis-Seliverstoff 1981, 15). Whatever the
factors influencing trends, Russian bond prices during the war must have
seemed reassuring to an outside observer and at least as good as their
French counterparts. Such confidence no doubt bolstered many French
small investors’ faith in the excellent quality of Russian credit. :

In March (February) 1917 Russian and French bond yields began
to diverge: as yields on Russian bonds increased, yields on the rente
firmed up or remained steady.*! The March (February) demonstrations,
the abdication of the tsar, and the October Revolution obviously had a
major impact on Russian bond prices. The causes of the 1917 revolu-
tions have been studied in depth elsewhere. I will therefore make only
passing reference to the revolution itself, and the analysis will focus on
its impact on bond prices.

The February Days of 1917 began with a peaceful workers’ demon-
stration in Saint Petersburg. Since the authorities did not respond, the
demonstrators stepped up their action, and the number of strikes in-
creased dramatically. As the movement spread, the government sent in
troops to restore order. To the government's astonishment, the soldiers
refused to fire on the demonstrators, forcing the officers to do the dirty
work in their place. When the soldiers saw the atrocities committed by
their commanding officers, they rallied to the demonstrators’ cause. The
subsequent raid on the arsenal and the distribution of weapons to the
crowd precipitated the downfall of the tsar.

In light of developments on the street, the members of the Duma
were forced to take a stance. By welcoming revolutionary elements, Al-
exander Kerensky, the Socialist-revolutionary politician, brought about
a rapprochement between insurgents and parliamentarians. This led to
the country being governed by two sources of power: the Provisional
Committee of the State Duma and the Saint Petersburg Soviet. Mis-
judging their relative strengths, the two camps sought a compromise
solution, which led to the formation of a provisional government on 15
March (Werth 2004, 88-89). In the end, only one member of this gov-
ernment—Kerensky, who accepted the justice portfolio—sympathized
with the revolutionary movements. That same evening, on the advice
of his army chiefs and ministers, Nicholas II abdicated in favor of his
brother, Grand Duke Michael. After receiving threats, Michael signed
his own abdication the following day, marking the end of the Romanov
dynasty (Figes 1996, 339-45).

The fall of tsarism was not mourned by Russia’s allies. The figure of
the tsar, popularized at the time of the Franco-Russian Alliance, was not
especially missed by French politicians (Hogenhuis-Seliverstoff 1981,
15). In March 1917 the president of the French senate expressed his best
wishes to the Russian constitutional government, saying that an era of
freedom had opened up in the east and that Germany would now be
encircled by a “coalition of democracies.” In the United Kingdom the
economist John Maynard Keynes wrote to his mother that the revolu-
tion was the “sole result of the war . .. worth having.”

Russia's new government rapidly sought recognition from the Allies.
On 17 March 1917 it undertook to honor the commitments made by
the imperial government (Hogenhuis-Seliverstoff 1981, 16). At the time,
the Allies’ main concern was the provisional government's position on the
pursuit of the war. The foreign minister, Pavel Miliukov, reasserted Rus-
sia’s aims and desire to pursue the war until victory was achieved. This
reassured the Allies but drew sharp criticism from members of the So-
viet. The clash between the annexationist and anti-imperialist positions
led to the April Crisis, which resulted in Miliukov’s resignation and a
cabinet reshuffle that brought new Socialist ministers into the govern-
ment (Werth 2004, 103).

With respect to Russia’s debt, the provisional government declared
it would honor the financial obligations of the previous government,
particularly the coupon and amortization payments due on sovereign
bonds (Sack 1927; Freymond 1996). Redemption of the bonds did not
seem to be much cause for concern at that time. The civil strife in Russia
barely dented confidence in its repayment capacity. The political insta-
bility and its negative impact on market prices seem to have been per-
ceived as temporary.*> Russia's vast territory and natural wealth sup-
ported the perception that it had the wherewithal to redeem its bonds.*°

In a decree dated 27 March 1917 the provisional government
turned to the bond market by issuing a so-called liberty bond. Trotsky
(1995, 325) argued that the new issue enabled the government to demon-
strate its intention to honor all its debt. According to Eliacheff (1919,
149), the issue raised more than 4 billion rubles by the end of September
1917. Subscribed by almost nine hundred thousand people, the issue
enjoyed the support of French political and social institutions as well as
of banks and the press. Werth (2004, 106) says the bonds were unpopu-
lar with the Russian bourgeoisie. Conversely, an issue of Le Rentier in
May 1917 reported that in France “the liberty bond issue seems to be
proceeding well? while an undefined number of bonds were purchased
in other countries, chiefly the United Kingdom.”
Despite the unrest in Russia and falling prices, a section of the
French financial press continued to urge its readers not to act in haste.
These newspapers argued that a mass sell-off of Russian bonds would
only make the situation worse. The main advice given at the beginning
of July was to wait and see.>® It was in this context that the crisis of sum-
mer 1917 arose. In June 1917 Kerensky’s government began maneuvers
in preparation for a major offensive against the German enemy. But after
a few short-lived Russian successes, the German counteroffensive broke
through Russian lines. Fearing a German advance, the soldiers in the
capital mutinied. The mutiny was brutally put down, causing Vladimir
Lenin to flee to Finland, undermining the credibility of the far left, and
facilitating the rise of the Constitutional Democrat Party (Kadet party).
As a result of a reorganization of the army, General Lavr Kornilov was
placed in command of the troops. Boosted by his growing popularity,
Kornilov attempted a coup but was outmaneuvered by Kerensky with
support from the Bolsheviks. This was a turning point in the Russian
revolution, as the Kadets, who had supported Kornilov, were eliminated,
thereby paving the way for the return of the Bolsheviks.

French investors seem to have been aware of the import of the
events in Russia, as yields on Russian bonds increased again in August
1917. The increase can probably be attributed primarily to the worsen-
ing political situation in Russia, aggravated by worse-than-anticipated
budget estimates and the weakness of the ruble. Despite the fall in prices,
the Russian government described the liberty bond as a success in that
it had raised 3.5 billion rubles.*° The veracity of that claim is question-
able, however, and the government may simply have been seeking to
restore the image of its finances through a positive announcement. In
the months that followed the July Days, the Bolsheviks built up their
power as the state collapsed. Kerensky’s proclamation of a republic in
September 1917 failed to lift bond prices. The political and economic
uncertainty did influence the price of Russian bonds listed in Paris,
since even before the October Revolution Russian bonds had begun to
decline on the French market. -

In September 1917 Lenin was practically the only leftist leader
arguing for a coup détat (Werth 2004, 122). His repeated attacks on
“revolutionary legalism,’ however, eventually achieved their desired ef-
fect, and a majority of the central committee voted for armed insurrec-
tion. The uprising began in early November (late October 1917). On
7 November (25 October) the Bolsheviks took power and installed a
Provisional Government of Workers and Peasants. Lack of knowledge
about the aims of the various revolutionary groups, combined with still-
effective censorship, left French investors unable to form a clear opinion
regarding the future political evolution in Russia (Hogenhuis-Seliverstoff
1981, 32). The term Maximalist was used in reference to the Bolsheviks,
but there did not seem to be much awareness of what the name implied.
The Bourse did not expect a group sometimes seen as German agents to
last long. Some French newspapers advised readers to be patient and not
sell their Russian bonds (Freymond 1996, 42). This uncertainty, based
on ignorance, naturally increased the perception of risk inherent in in-
vesting in Russian bonds. As a result, yields on Russian bonds jumped
between late October and December 1917, reflecting the gravity of Rus-
sia’s domestic political situation.”
The Repudiation of Russia’s Debt

The repudiation of Russia’s debt was on some people’s minds well be-
fore it happened. On 23 November 1917 an article in Novaia Zhizr crit-
icized the debt. The author, Yuri Larin, said that nonrepayment would
be a choice punishment for the French capitalists he accused of having
brought about the war. Consequently, he described repudiation as “one
of the most natural and necessary conditions for peace” (Noulens 1933,
1:150-51; Mourin 1967, 66). This opinion proved highly popular and
was repeated in the press and in speeches. According to Noulens (1933,
1:150), the repudiation announcement sent jitters through stock ex-
changes in London, Paris, and Amsterdam. Rumors that the “people's
commissars” would repudiate the debt were circulating in France and
the United Kingdom by late December 1917.*! The rumors had only
some basis in truth, as what seemed to be an official position, for exam-
ple, turned out to be only an opinion in Pravda.” In any case, the mar-
ket was clearly aware of worrying rumors, even if it was unable to deter-
mine whether they were true. The uncertainty about the decisions that
had actually been taken lasted several weeks.

On 27 December 1917 (15 December) a decree on bank national-
ization was published in Izvestiia (Martin 1921). On 11 January 1918
(29 December 1917) the Official Journal of the Provisional Government
(29 December 1917) the Official Journal of the Provisional Government
of Workers and Peasants published a decree on cessation of payment of
coupons and dividends. The decree suspended all coupon payments and
banned all securities trading.*® On 8 February (26 January) Pravda pub-
lished a summary of the decree on the cancellation of state debt, ad-
opted on 21 January (8 January) by the Central Executive Committee.
Signed by the chairman of the Central Executive Committee, Iakov
Sverdlov, the decree stipulated:
1. “All state debts contracted by the Russian government are
cancelled as of 1 December 1917;
2. “Loan guarantees extended by the Russian government
are also cancelled;
3. “All foreign debt is cancelled unconditionally and with-
out exception; :
The trend in Russian bonds’ yields is surprising in several respects
(Oosterlinck 2003a). First, Russian yields were very close to French ones
at the beginning of the period. In January 1917, after nearly two and a
half years of war, the spread between Russian bonds and French rentes
was below 170 basis points. Second, although Russian bond prices
dropped sharply during 1917, yields stabilized by the end of that year. At
the end of December 1917, when rumors of the Soviet repudiation of
Russian debt first began to circulate on Western markets, yields on the
1906 5 percent bond were still below 10 percent. The spread with the
French rente did not reach even 500 basis points. When the repudiation
was Officially announced, yields increased only moderately, which seems
to indicate that the repudiation rumors had already been priced in and
that the repudiation itself was not initially perceived as particularly
credible. According to Hogenhuis-Seliverstoff (1981, 72), investors did
not expect the Bolshevik regime to last long and were therefore more
concerned with nationalizations than with repudiation. The yield trend
appears to confirm this view.

Third, Russian bonds continued to perform well for several years,
despite having been repudiated. The 1906 5 percent bond was still trad-
ing at 45 percent of par in April 1918.” This price was the equivalent of
an 11.6 percent yield to maturity. Yields did not rise above that level
until January 1920. On the contrary, Russian bonds even enjoyed peri-
ods of euphoria that pushed yields well below 8.5 percent several times.
The relatively modest decline in Russian bond prices was not unique to
the French market. In New York, at the end of February 1918, Russian
bonds, although at a several-year low, were trading at almost 40 percent
of face value.*° : :

Even when yields on Russian bonds increased in 1920, the yield on
the 1906 bond was still at around 20 percent. Aside from a few jumps
yields stabilized in 1921, but the market was mainly characterized by a
contraction in trading volumes. To be sure, the fact that the market re-
quired a 20 percent yield to maturity to hold Russian bonds is testimony
to their riskiness. However, set in historical perspective these yields were
relatively low given that the bonds had been in default for more than
three years.

Was the resilience of Russian bonds atypical? One way to address
this question is to compare the Russian experience with other cases of
sovereign debt crisis. The beginning of the twenty-first century has wit-
nessed two dramatic crises: the Argentinean default in 2001 and the
eurozone crisis that started in 2007 and affected Portugal, Italy, Ire-
land, and Greece. After several years of recession Argentina defaulted
on its foreign debt in December 2001. The principal of the foreign bonds
amounted to close to USD 82 billion, making the Argentine default one
of the largest in history. The eurozone crisis followed the 2007 global
financial crisis. At the end of 2009 several eurozone countries experi-
enced a severe economic deterioration that prompted investors to ques-
tion the ability to repay the debt (Lane 2012). Even though several coun-
tries were affected, Greece was the most dramatic case. In October 2009
the new government revealed that the fiscal deficit would reach 12.7
percent of GDP, double the original figure. The situation deteriorated so
quickly that the country required financial assistance in early 2010. In
May 2010 the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank,
and the European Commission reached an agreement with Greece,
which received a €110-billion adjustment loan in exchange for a com-
mitment to lower its fiscal deficit (Gibson, Hall, and Tavlas 2012). This
rescue proved to be too small, and in July 2011 eurozone leaders agreed
to issue a second rescue package. In October 2011 bondholders were
asked to accept a 50 percent reduction in the face value of the bonds as
well as a reduction in interest rates. In February 2012 a final agreement
was reached, and bonds were exchanged, leading to an estimated loss of
75 percent for private creditors.*! This agreement prompted the Interna-
tional Swaps and Derivatives Association to trigger credit default swaps
on Greek bonds, as the compulsory nature of the exchange was viewed
as a credit event.*?

Both Argentina and Greece make good points of comparison. In a
sense the Argentine case is even more compelling than the Greek one.
Indeed, in the Argentinean case bondholders had no hope of a bailout.
The situation of Greece was more complex. Bondholders could reason-
ably expect to see the European Union intervene in one way or another
to help the country. In this case yields on Greek bonds would have been
lower than those on their Argentinean counterparts. I shall therefore
usually compare yields with the Greek case. That said, spreads on Ar-
gentinean bonds provide very similar results and will also be discussed
shortly.

The Russian yields presented earlier offer insights about expecta-
tions for Russian bonds. However, spreads with a benchmark are a more
traditional yardstick to gauge bonds’ riskiness and markets’ expecta-
tions regarding reimbursement. Figure 0.3 shows the fluctuations in
Greek and Russian spreads compared with bonds issued by Germany
(in the Greek case) and France (in the Russian case).** In order to com-
pare these spreads, the origin date is set at the date of default (the first
week of February 1918 for Russian bonds and the last week of October
2011 for Greece), and the figures on the horizontal axis show the num-
ber of weeks before or after the default.>* Figure 0.3 covers three years
before the default and slightly less than two years afterward.

The spread movements depicted in figure 0.3 are testimony to the
differences between the Russian and Greek cases. Greek spreads in-
creased dramatically well before default was officially declared. Inves-
tors were expecting the default more than 75 weeks before it occurred.
By contrast, the Russian spread reached only 500 basis points a few
weeks before the repudiation was declared. The difference in order of
magnitude is also striking. For the period under consideration the Rus-
sian spreads remain in the range of 500 basis points, while the Greek
spreads are above 1,000 basis points for a very long period, reaching a
maximum of 4,400! Due to data constraints, the figure ends 102 weeks
after the defaults. By that time both spreads had converged, and there-
after the Russian spread began to increase again. However, even at the
end of 1921 it was still below 2,000 basis points.

Greece is just one point of comparison. How do Russian spreads
compare to the Argentinean case? Spreads on Argentinean bonds reached
even higher values than their Greek counterparts. For instance, the
spread between the Argentinean Emerging Market Bond Index (com-
puted by JP Morgan) and US Treasuries was well above 5,000 basis
points at the end of 2001 (IMF 2004). Could the difference be explained
by the exceptional severity of the Greek and Argentinean cases? or by
changes in markets’ appreciation of risk? If either is the case, comparing
with a less severe episode of default occurring in the past might present
additional insights. The Romanian debt crisis of the 1930s, for example,
January 1918 the opinion of various market professionals was that it was
both the wrong time to buy Russian paper and, for those with Russian
bonds in their portfolios, the wrong time to sell. Trading in Russian
bonds probably reached its lowest point at the end of March 1918, when
the press questioned even the representativeness of prices.°* In August
1918 Le Rentier reported a recovery in Russian bonds.™ Similarly, in
September 1918 La Revue des Valeurs Russes, a supplement to La Lettre
Hebdomadaire, noted a pickup in trading in Russian bonds, which it
said had been practically nonexistent for many months.® But by August
1919 the market was confused again. Le Rentier considered prices to be
either “too high or too low, depending on whether or not Russia will
succeed in ridding itself of Bolshevism.”

In all likelihood the profile of typical investors changed over time.
The original savers who bought Russian bonds because of their sup-
posed low risk were succeeded by much more risk-hungry investors,
who probably viewed Russian bonds as a kind of lottery. Trading in the
Russian segment resumed in January 1920." In May 1920 Le Rentier
commented that prices for Russian bonds in France were meaningless
and that bondholders should bide their time.® In July of the same year
the Russian bond segment was described as inactive once again. Trading
in Russian bonds in the United Kingdom, according to several issues of
in Russian bonds in the United Kingdom, according to several issues of
The Economist, alternated between periods of renewed activity and dead
calm. At the end of 1920 the chairman of the Paris stockbrokers’ syndi-
cate decided to suspend trading in Russian bonds for two weeks to avoid
quoting rock-bottom prices, despite public opposition to the measure.”
Trading volumes became smaller and smaller from 1921 on, and large
orders could rarely be filled.”” In October 1922 a senator who lobbied
actively for the repayment of Russian bonds nevertheless observed “con-
stant speculation in Russian debt securities.””!

Although the volume of trade in Russian bonds varied enormously
during the period under review, and even though trading practically
ceased altogether at times, there generally seemed to be no reason to
question the representativeness of prices. Prices usually changed from
one day to the next, implying that at least one trade took place per day.
Moreover, prices frequently changed several times in the course of a day,
which further supports the volume argument. Moreover, according to
the descriptions in the contemporary financial press, every pronounced
rise in market prices corresponds to an increase in the volume of Rus-
sian bonds traded. Finally, when the press refers to problems of volume,
these reflect a radical difference in valuation between potential buyers
and sellers rather than an inability to sell the securities. By refusing to
pay the prices asked by sellers, potential buyers evidently did not assign
the same probability to repayment as bondholders. Only on very few
occasions did the press mention the influence of trading volumes on
quoted prices.”” On the whole, therefore, the fact that prices remained
high does not seem due to a problem of microstructure. In fact, the
market seems to have been completely lifeless at the very end of the pe-
riod under review, by which time prices had already fallen to relatively
low levels.

The Russian bondholders’ sense of injustice left a deep scar in
France, one which was passed from one generation to the next. But, as
Szurek (2002) notes, despite this national disaster, “the bondholders—
and later their beneficiaries—never gave up completely on their fortunes
or modest savings annihilated by the October Revolution.”

The behavior of market prices can be explained to some extent by
the so-called peso problem. Far from being a sign of irrational behavior,
investors’ hopes were based on an expectation of one or more extreme
events that would lead to repayment. This view is confirmed by wit-
nesses to the events. Léon Martin (1921, 225), the secretary of the Gen-
eral Commission for the Protection of French Interests in Russia (Com-
mission générale pour la protection des intéréts francais en Russie),
commented that “the Bourse, after weighing up the creditors’ chances
of recovering their loans, assigns a value to these securities that would
not be warranted by an assessment based solely on the actual situation
at present.”

The variety of grounds for retaining hope reflects the complexity
of the military and political situation in Russia, France, and Europe gen-
erally. While some of the reasons given below might seem unrealistic in
hindsight, contemporary written sources indicate that they were not so
at the time. Different reasons for hopefulness were apparent very early
on. They are all described in the first communiqué of the General Com-
mission for the Protection of French Interests in Russia in August 1918.”
Government bonds might seem straightforward, but the sovereign
nature of the issuer bears various implications that actually make them
highly complex instruments. The power imbalance between retail inves-
tors and the government they have lent to severely limits the action the
investors can take to force repayment. The literature identifies four key
incentives governments have to repay their debts: fear of a loss of repu-
tation and consequent exclusion from capital markets; fear of armed
intervention; trade sanctions; and seizure of collateral. In the Russian
case investors remained hopeful for the aforementioned reasons, but
they also hoped that a third-party government would stand in for the
Russian government and fulfill its obligations.

The possibility of a rapid overthrow of the Bolshevik regime was
one of the most obvious reasons to keep hope alive. The possibility that
the regime would change its stance was not ruled out by investors either,
since they thought the Bolsheviks’ extreme position was untenable in
the long run. A negotiated settlement therefore also seemed to be a ra-
tional expectation. Last, the hope that another government could repay
the debt persisted for several years. There are several circumstances in
which an alternative administration could intervene. France might have
bailed out French investors to mitigate the losses incurred by its citizens.
The new countries that emerged from the ruins of the tsarist empire
might have taken responsibility for some or all of the debt, in accor-
dance with the succession of states and precedents in international law.
And finally, Russia might have demanded that Germany repay some of
its debt as compensation for the First World War.

My book seeks to assess the relative weight of each of these reasons
to hope. The first chapter describes the financial instrument that is my
main focus, namely, sovereign debt. The subsequent chapters have the
following structure: a theoretical introduction that provides background
with regard to each reason that gave investors hope, followed by an anal-
ysis based on the history of Russian bonds.

The second chapter examines reputation and negotiations as rea-
sons people’s hope persisted. The third chapter is devoted to the impact
of wartime events on market prices for Russian bonds. The fourth chap-
ter describes the hope that French bondholders would be bailed out by
their own government. The fifth chapter analyzes expectations of partial
repayment, either by the new states that emerged from the ruins of the
tsarist empire or by the defeated Germany. The sixth chapter details all
the econometric and financial analyses performed on the Russian data
to assess the relative importance of each of these factors. The seventh
and final chapter summarizes salient points about the Russian case and
highlights what the analysis of the Russian repudiation can add to the
modern literature on sovereign bonds.
